                <h1>Toggle Navigation - NO JS</h1>
                <p>This is a demonstration of the css toggle navigation menu I used on my website, <a href="http://www.joesnellpdx.com">JoeSnellPDX.com</a>, built with CSS and no JavaScript.  Initially, my navigation was built with JS, but I was inspired to make a change.</p>  
                <p>My inspiration was brought on after reading Brad Frost's blog post about his site redesign, <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/this-is-an-updated-website/">This Is An Updated Website</a>, where he used a no JS navigation pattern.  In his post, he references an article written by Aaron Gustafson, <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/build-smart-mobile-navigation-without-hacks">Build a smart mobile navagation without hacks</a>, which I used heavily as a reference.  At that time, I forked Brad Frost's Toggle Nav with my first rendition of <a href+"http://codepen.io/joesnellpdx/pen/mFeHd">Toggle Navigatin: NO JS</a>.  Incidentally, David Bushnell recently wrote a fantastic article, <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/">Implementing Off-Canvas Navigation for A Responsive Website</a>, on the same topic since my site was built and is another great reference.</p>
            <p>On my website, I use several navigation patterns.  This is where I started.  For further details on the development of this navigation pattern, visit <a hfref="http://www.joesnellpdx.com/toggle-navigation-no-javascript/">Toggle Navigation - No JavaScript</a> on my <a href="http://www.joesnellpdx.com/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
                <p>I built this demonstration using Sass and Compass, but, for demonstration purposes, I have chosen to display the extended CSS. </p>
